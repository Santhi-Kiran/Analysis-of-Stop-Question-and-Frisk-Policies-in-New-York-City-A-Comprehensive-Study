# Analysis-of-Stop-Question-and-Frisk-Policies-in-New-York-City-A-Comprehensive-Study
This project analyzes New York City's "stop, question, and frisk" policy using data from 2003 to 2019. It explores arrest, frisk, and search statistics by gender and race, performs ANOVA and linear regression analyses to predict arrests, and assesses the accuracy of logistic regression models to determine gender prediction from the data.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to:

Investigate the impact of the stop, question, and frisk policy on various demographics.
Identify patterns and trends in the data related to arrests, frisks, and searches.
Use statistical methods to analyze the effectiveness of the policy and predict future outcomes.
Evaluate the accuracy of models predicting gender from the data.
